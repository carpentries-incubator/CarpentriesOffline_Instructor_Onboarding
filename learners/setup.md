Learners will need to bring a laptop or have access to a desktop computer with an SD card reader. If the laptop or computer does not have a built-in SD card reader, the learner will require a USB card reader.

Learners need to make sure they have administrative access to the computer they will be working on because they will be required during the workshop to download, install and run the Raspberry Pi Imager.
